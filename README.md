# About the Project
  In this Project, objective was to analyze large amount of data using SQL and come up with insights.


## Aim
 The project aim was to use the data that was provided of the E-comm website of Brazil and come up with information from the raw data and use it for analysis to check
 the performance of the website in the span of 3 years.


## Tech stack: 
  - SQL 
  - Excel
  - Pivot Tables
  - Pivot Charts
  - Microsoft Power Point 
 
 ## Prerequisite
  - One would just need SQL, for this Project I have used Microsoft SQL Server
  - Microsoft office that everyone usually have
  - Basic understanding of SQL
  
  ## Kick off(Importing data)
  - We would need to import the data in the SQL server 
  - For that I created a database and imported all the files in them
  - There were in total of 8 files which had information of customers, location, orderitem etc 
  
  ## Extract information from data
  - As the data that is provided raw and we can not come up with any conclusion that is why SQL serves was used to write the command 
    to get the information.
    
   ## Data Visualization 
   - For this I then imported the information into excel so that Pivot Graphs can be used to show the findings
   
   ## Some findings 
   - Here map chart was used to show the customer customer acquisition over the span of 3 year form 2016,2017 and 2018

  For all the finding PPT is provided 
  
  ## Conclusion 
  From this analysis we can figure out that the website is booming but there are some issues to that needs to be catered to, for eg - no repeating customers and less 
  seller in the city
